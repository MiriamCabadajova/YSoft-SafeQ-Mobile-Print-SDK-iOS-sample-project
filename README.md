# YSoft SafeQ Mobile Print SDK iOS
## Sample mobile application
This is a sample mobile application for the iOS platform depicting the usage of the mobile SDK developed for the YSoft Corporation a.s., for accessing the functionality of SafeQ product.

The main functionality included in the SDK is the login and upload to the YSoft SafeQ using two main channels - End User Interface and the Mobile Integration Gateway.

The mobile SDK is supplied in the *YSoft SafeQ SDK* folder. It includes *Login.swift* and *Upload.swift* classes comprising the core functionality of SDK and *Printjob.swift* struct representing the print jobs to be uploaded to the YSoft SafeQ. Their integration into the code is shown in the *LoginViewController.swift* and *UploadViewController.swift* classes. The application contains only basic UI elements as they will be chosen and modified by software engineers developing the mobile application with their custom assets. 

You can launch the application by clicking the file with *.xcodeproj* suffix. 

For more detailed instructions on how to integrate the mobile SDK into your iOS application and utilize its functionality, see the bachelor's thesis...
